# jQuery - fieldSelection

A jQuery plugin to get'n'set the caret/selection.

## Description

Retrieve the caret (text cursor) position from textareas and input
fields as well as the actual selection and its index boundaries.
Replacing the selection string is also supported. Unfortunately special
treatment for such a simple thing is needed, because MSIE doesn't
support the easy DOM 3.0 methods.

## Status

First public release: `getSelection` and `replaceSelection` basically works.

for further updates.

## Requirements
